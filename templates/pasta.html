        <h2>Description</h2>
        This is a recipe that we have made in our family for many years--everyone loves it. It's a very basic and easy variation on mac 'n cheese. 
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 pound spaghetti 
            </li>
            <li>
                6 tablespoons olive oil 
            </li>
            <li>
                2 cloves garlic, minced 
            </li>
            <li>
                2 teaspoons ground black pepper 
            </li>
            <li>
                1 ¾ cups grated Pecorino Romano cheese
